# Defense Points

We propose a security feature called unpredictable background to defense against GeeSolver, as shown below.

For each triplet, we exhibit the ground-truth (top), the masked captcha (middle), and MAE reconstruction (bottom).

In the case of the same mask, MAE cannot fully recover the captcha characters due to the interference of complex background noise, which indicates that adding unpredictable background can present MAE from extracting high-quality representations.
